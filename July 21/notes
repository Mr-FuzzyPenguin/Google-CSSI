Apparently you have multiple different ways of calling values to an object. You can treat an object similar to the way you would treat a dictionary in Python, where you can refer to it by calling the variable that contains the object (or dictionary, for Python-eers), and then use the key in square brackets:
a_dict_or_object_i_suppose["something-like-this"]

Still, my js code is a mess... I don't think anybody would like to read it. So my suggestion is: Don't! And if you do... Let's just hope that I come around to actually finish adding my comments and that I don't just leave it at this and give up.

I also happened to also figure out how to make the JS only allow the user to select 1 of each favorite (question type goes here). Hooray for that! Too many for loops...

To do:
- Fix the dang comments, so that my code is >20% readable
- Display the test results to the user (graphically)
  - It works in the terminal
  - Map that onto the HTML
  - Uncomment the code and analyze in script.js
