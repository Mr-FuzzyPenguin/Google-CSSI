# Google-CSSI
This is my repository full of websites that I have designed and made in the Google CSSI learning experience during the summer of 2022! Hello to Cohort 22!
A special thanks to Cohort 22, and the Googlers for teaching, learning, and supporting alongside me ~~and dealing with my technological shenanigans as I insisted on not using [replit](https://replit.com/@STANLEYCOKRO)~~!

## A few notes:
##### Feel free to go about downloading my code and fooling around with it, I believe that's how many of us learn most effectively! Just note that because these HTML, JS, and CSS projects were among the first few projects that I have made while learning about web-dev, for the rather _more experienced_ individuals out there, this project was not the greatest pieces of code that I had written, but regardless, I am stil proud over the things I have achieved. I could have been wasting my summer on other stuff, but I am proud to say that I have used my time wisely by not only learning about web-dev, but also about VCS, and learning about git during the proccess!

## Have fun, learn something new!
##### I hope you learned something from reading my notes and reading my code, even if I failed to teach/get my idea accross successfully. Also, according to my standards:
##### _One is only a master when they can successfully teach the subject to someone else._
##### Do remember that I was only a COMPLETE beginner when I made this. I am still looking forward to learning more, so I would most definitely agree that I have learned a lot, and might be able to teach some topics!
