Log for July 14th

Today we learned JS. I decided to make something similar to a pet simulator. This was headachesome, so I made functions to make my life easier. Looks like I jumped ahead of myself and bumped into global and local variables when I used functions... Although I should mention that it was great!

It works great as well, the bounds were properly set, debugging was not fun because it was cross-file, but I adapted my workflow with my text editor, console, and website in a nice way. Thanks to Kate Text Editor, KDE's Konsole, and Firefox's amazing console functionalities, I got to finish this amazing website!!

And lastly, thanks to Repl.it for hosting this!




P.S.
If Billy reads this: Sadly, I was unable to figure out the delay thing that you were showing me and discussing with me earlier... Though, I will try to have another go at it in the near future, and I hope we get into that stuff in CSSI soon!
